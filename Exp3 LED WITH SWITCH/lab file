Aim:
To turn a LED on and off using switch.
Theory:
Analysing the concept of switch.
How we can turn a LED on and off usinf a push button ao a switch on audrino board and breadboard.
Learning and observations:
After connecting all the wires with audrino and breadboard and the Usb cables alongwith a switch the led glows when the switch is pressed.
Problems and troubleshooting:
Loose connection of cables.
Loose connections of LED bulbs.
Error in programming or coding.
Precautions:
While unplugging the USB ,pull the plug nt the cable.
Connectionns should be tight and according to the coding done on audrino software.
Handle the apparatus like AUDRINO BOARD ,LED wires and breadboard carefully.
Learning Outcomes:
Working and appearence of Audrino.
Lighting of LED using audrino board and software and switch.
Design and analysis of breadboard alongwith its circuit diagram.
