Aim:
Design a LED Chasor.
Theory:
Led Chaser is a circuit which blinks LEDs in a particular frequency and particular pattern so that it provides the effect of illusion, LED are moving. These LED chasers are used in decorative lighting.
Learning and Observations:
When  LEDs are connected on a breadboard and audrino and the circuit is completed by creating a potential difference the connected LEDs glows and blinks according to the program code on audrino screen .
the main and basic learning from this chasoris that they  anly glows when a potential difference is created accross the circuit it is when the current flows and led functions.
Problems and troubleshooting:
Loose connection of cables.
Loose connections of LED bulbs.
Error in programming or coding.
Precautions:
While unplugging the USB ,pull the plug nt the cable.
Connectionns should be tight and according to the coding done on audrino software.
Handle the apparatus like AUDRINO BOARD ,LED wires and breadboard carefully.
Learning Outcomes:
Working and appearence of Audrino.
Lighting of LED using audrino board and software and switch.
Design and analysis of breadboard alongwith its circuit diagram.
