Aim:
Design a LED Flasher.
Theory:
A LED flasher is also known as a LED blinker. It is a device in which a LED turns ON and OFF at certain time intervals.
Learning and Observations:
When a LED is connected on a breadboard and audrino and the circuit is completed by creating a potential difference the connected LED glows and blinks according to the program code on audrino screen .
the main and basic learning from this blinker is that it anly glows when a potential difference is created accross the circuit it is when the current flows and led functions.
Problems and troubleshooting:
Loose connection of cables.
Loose connections of LED bulbs.
Error in programming or coding.
Precautions:
While unplugging the USB ,pull the plug nt the cable.
Connectionns should be tight and according to the coding done on audrino software.
Handle the apparatus like AUDRINO BOARD ,LED wires and breadboard carefully.
Learning Outcomes:
Working and appearence of Audrino.
Lighting of LED using audrino board and software .
Design and analysis of breadboard alongwith its circuit diagram.
