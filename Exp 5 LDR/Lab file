Aim:
Analyses of a LDR (Light dependent resistor).
Theory:
LDR-Light Dependent Resistors
The passive component is basically a resistor whose resistance value decreases when the intensity of light decreases. This optoelectronic device is mostly used in light varying sensor circuit, and light and dark activated switching circuits.
The most common type of LDR has a resistance that falls with an increase in the light intensity falling upon the device 
When the light level decreases, the resistance of the LDR increases. As this resistance increases in relation to the other Resistor, which has a fixed resistance, it causes the voltage dropped across the LDR to also increase.
The value of the fixed resistor will depend on the LDR used, the transistor used and the supply voltage.
Learning and Observations:
When light falls i.e. when the photons fall on the device, the electrons in the valence band of the semiconductor material are excited to 
the conduction band. These photons in the incident light should have energy greater than the band gap of the semiconductor material to make
the electrons jump from the valence band to the conduction band. Hence when light having enough energy strikes on the device, more and more
electrons are excited to the conduction band which results in large number of charge carriers. The result of this process is more and more 
and hence it is said that the resistance of the device has been decreased.
